
Ideas:
* Deposit accounts for the money collected when building/creating/linking/using gates.
* Implement gate permissions when Permissions plugin supports adding a gate to a group.
* Per-world inventories?
* Add API options like allow*
* Add more realm commands
    * delete <player>
    * list (lists all player names, maybe with some meta data)

TODO:

Testing:
* Test stairs with facing option

Wiki Updates:
* Add FAQ: added servers but they won't connect
* Remove debugURL config option
* Explain Inquisitor integration

Changelog:
* Removed all player statistics collection.
* Realm support now requires the Inquisitor plugin (also by me).
* Add support for NBT tags on inventory. This is a BETA so it's probably broken. If you're using this plugin with IndustrialCraft, give it a try and let me know how it works.
