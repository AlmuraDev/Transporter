
Ideas:
* Deposit accounts for the money collected when building/creating/linking/using gates.
* Implement gate permissions when Permissions plugin supports adding a gate to a group.
* Per-world inventories?
* Add API options like allow*

TODO:
* Add world gates that only accept arrivals and no outbound links. Lets server place player in the world?
* Remove requirement of server name matching configured servers by sending bukkit server name to remote host and providing a way to lookup a server based on that name.
* Better handling of unconnected server during realm join and respawn; option to kick, option to restore

Testing:
* Test stairs with facing option

Wiki Updates:
* Add FAQ: added servers but they won't connect
* Document new realm options, server naming requirements
* Document server gates

Changelog:
* Fixed bug: gate duration was not being copied from design file.
* Fixed bug: gate's not properly "opening" when attached from other gate.
* Added new gate type, "server". See [[Gates]] for more information.
* Removed realm requirement that configured server name matches remote server name, but remote name must be unique within connected servers! See [[Realms]] for more information.
* Add realm options "serverOfflineFormat", "restoreWhenServerOffline", "restoreWhenServerOfflineFormat", "kickWhenServerOffline", "kickWhenServerOfflineFormat". See [[Realms]] for more information.
