
Ideas:
* Deposit accounts for the money collected when building/creating/linking/using gates.
* Implement gate permissions when Permissions plugin supports adding a gate to a group.
* Per-world inventories?
* Add API options like allow*

TODO:
* Add world gates that only accept arrivals and no outbound links. Lets server place player in the world?
* Add commands to extract part of a world into a design file.
* Add feedback output when server connect command is given (http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/transporter/?comment=1012).



Testing:
* Test stairs with facing option
