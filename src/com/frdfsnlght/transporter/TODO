* Deposit accounts for the money collected when building/creating/linking/using gates.
* Implement gate permissions when Permissions plugin supports adding a gate to a group.
* Per-world inventories?
* Add API options like allow*

Testing:
* Test stairs with facing option

Wiki Updates:

* Document new realm options, server naming requirements
* Document server gates
