
Ideas:
* Deposit accounts for the money collected when building/creating/linking/using gates.
* Implement gate permissions when Permissions plugin supports adding a gate to a group.
* Per-world inventories?
* Add API options like allow*
* Add more realm commands
    * delete <player>
    * list (lists all player names, maybe with some meta data)

TODO:

Testing:
* Test stairs with facing option

Wiki Updates:
* Add FAQ: added servers but they won't connect

Changelog:
* Added realm options "respawnGate" and "defaultGate".
* Added more player stats to realm support and changed realm database player table definition (see [[Realms]]).
* Added gate option "receiveStats" (defaults to true) to control player health, remaining air, food level, exhaustion, saturation, and fire ticks.
* Changed player kicking technique for inter-server teleports.
