
Ideas:
* Deposit accounts for the money collected when building/creating/linking/using gates.
* Implement gate permissions when Permissions plugin supports adding a gate to a group.
* Realms!
    * Add a MySQL driver
    X Save player stuff to DB at periodic intervals
    * Web server to display customizable templates for player stats
    * On join, check DB and reconnect player to last server
    * On death, check DB for "realm home" and reconnect player
    * On quit, save player stuff in DB
    * Add command to set "realm home". "trp home"
    * Player stuff to save
        X client address
        X Name, displayName
        X Level, experience
        X Potion effects
        X Inventory, armor
        X air, food, fire
        X Server, world, location
        * Realm home
        X Realm name
        * Last join date/time
        X Last update date/time
        * Death count, last cause of death
* Per-world inventories?
* Add API options like allow*
