
Ideas:
* Deposit accounts for the money collected when building/creating/linking/using gates.
* Implement gate permissions when Permissions plugin supports adding a gate to a group.
* Per-world inventories?
* Add API options like allow*
* Add more realm commands
    * delete <player>
    * list (lists all player names, maybe with some meta data)
* Realm web server with templating engine
    * trp realm set webServerPort <port>
    * trp realm set webServer <true|false>

TODO:

Testing:
* Test stairs with facing option

Wiki Updates:
* Add realm commands to Commands
* Add new realm options to Realms
* Describe realm new players, player respawning

Changelog:
